        Thinkpad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard Function Key Switcher for MacOSX
        ====================================================================

About
======

This is [https://github.com/exlee/k810_fkeys_mac](https://github.com/exlee/k810_fkeys_mac) updated to enable FnLk
on the [Thinkpad Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with Trackpoint](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/pd026744)

It requires root privileges to run, so in order to be run it has to have
setuid bit set before launching, or run with `sudo`.

Feel free to work with it and use as needed.
